# Solving-first-order-ODEs
1. Overview

   This is a project which shows how to solve first order ODEs in Wolfram Language/ Wolfram Mathematica.

2. Mathematical Formulation
 
   The problems considered are simple first-order ODEs of the form:

   y'(x)=f(x,y), x ∈ [a, b]

   where y(a) = α, y(b) = β (Dirichlet)

3. Methods Used in Mathematica

   The differential equation is solved symbolically using Wolfram|Alpha and DSolve in Mathematica.

4. Files included
   • .nb notebook containing worked Mathematica solutions

   • .wl file containing executable Wolfram Language code

   • .pdf file contains exported problem statements and results

5. Academic Context

Intended for coursework and practice in ordinary differential equations using Wolfram Mathematica.
